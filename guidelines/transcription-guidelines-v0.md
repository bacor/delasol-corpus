# Delasol Transcription Guidelines (v0.1)

- Version: v0.1
- Last updated: 17 January 2025

Every collection is different, and will have its own guidelines. Here we establish
the general guidelines that are respected in all collections.

## General

Transcriptions are meant as (more or less) diplomatic editions, in principle not correcting mistakes, but only indicating editorial suggestions. Whenever obvious mistakes (e.g. misprints) have been corrected, this should be indicated in the editorial comments. Transcriptions should at least include the music and solmization syllables.


## Music
- **Note shapes.** Note shapes are modernized to use round instead of diamond shapes.
- **Ligatures** Ligatures are indicated by grouping grouping notes in a ligature under a slur. If applicable, underscores are used to extend the lyrics throughout the ligature.
- **Clef.** Music is transcribed in the original clef.
- **Time signature.** If applicable, transcribe in the original time signature. (For the psalms, this is usually cut time or a 4/2 meter.)
- **Barlines.** Use ordinary barlines in the transcription for easy reference (and not, say, Mensuralstriche). This might occassionally introduce ties when whole notes cross barlines. The final barline is transcribed as a double barline.
- **Ties.** All ties are editorial additions to transcribe notes across barlines, unless noted otherwise in the editorial comments.
- **Last note** The duration of the last note is shown as a double whole note, even when it is a longa in the source, and irrespective of whether it fits in the bar
- **Breaks & custos.** System breaks are indicated by placing a single dash caesura after the last note of a system; page breaks by a double dash caesura. At those places, a custos _corresponding to the next note_ appears in the source, unless explicitly noted otherwise in the editorial comments. This means custos not transcribed explicitly. Example of a editorial comment: `m. 10. The custos is inconsistent: it indicates an A instead of an E`.
- **No layout.** Do not edit the layout to keep the musicxml files clean. In particular, system and page breaks are not transcribed as such (but using caesura, see above).

## Metadata

- **Editorial comments.** An optional text frame at the end of a file discusses editorial choices.
- **Project Properties.** Add title, subtitle, lyricist, copyright as metadata to the project properties. Standard copyright message `Copyright Â© Bas Cornelissen 2024; CC BY-SA 4.0`. Insert the work id (e.g. `MdB026`) in the field 'Work number' and add a new property 'Editor' with the editor (e.g. `Bas Cornelissen`).

## Lyrics

Transcription guidelines for lyrics, if applicable, will vary substantially accross collections. 
Generally, the first line of lyrics is used for the actual lyrics, while solmizations are
annotated on the second line. But a collection without lyrics may put the solmization syllables
on the first line. It is important that this is documented in the `collection.yaml` file.


## Solmization syllables

Syllables are annotated using a simple scheme that can indicate uncertainty in the source
and editorial suggestions between square brackets:

- Valid syllables: `ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la`
- `?`: the syllable in the source is uncertain: unreadable or missing.
- `re`: there is a _re_ in the source.
- `?re`: there probably is a _re_ in the source, but there _substantial_ uncertainty.
  This may happen when part of the syllable is unreadable to the point that it is not
  possible to identify the syllable. When, say, only the 'r' is readable, there is _no_
  substantial uncertainty: the only syllable starting with an r, is _re_ after all.
- `?[mi]` the syllable is uncertain, and the editor suggest it should be a _mi_.
- `?re[mi]` the sylable in the source is probably a _re_, but the editor suggests it
  should be _mi_ instead.
- `re[fa]` indicates that there is a _re_ in the source, but the editor suggests it should
  be a _fa_ instead (e.g. misprint).
