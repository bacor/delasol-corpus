comments: >
  Both the 1574 and 1590 edition include solmization syllables. However, when transcribing the 1574 edition, I noticed many rhythmical irregularities: seemingly wrong note values, resulting in frequent syncopations. I therefore decided to transcribe the 1590 edition, which is more regular in its rhythm, and generally agrees with the 1574 edition on the melody. Whenever solmization syllables were missing from the 1590 edition that could be resolved from the 1574 edition, I have typeset them between square brackets. Missing syllables on repeated notes are set between round brackets. Page numbers on the top left refer to the 1590 edition.
