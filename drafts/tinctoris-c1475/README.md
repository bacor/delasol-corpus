# Tinctoris examples of mutations from Expositio Manus

## Issues

In order to keep 1 bar per breve AND to still display longas,
in MuseScore `Format->Style->Score` I checked out
``Display note values across bar boundaries (EXPERIMENTAL, early music only!)''.
box.

This setting seems **not to save** together with the `.mscz` file – when I pulled this repo, it was unchecked.

## Transcription guidelines

### Music
- **ligatures** are marked using _legato_ slurs;
- **rhythm notation** is interpreted as mensural (not plainchant);
- **longas** are displayed using MuseScore formatting (see `Issues`).

### Syllables
- Tinctoris lists only places of mutation, often not directly above the meant note but before it.
- `fa|ut` indicates explicit Tinctoris' mutation.
- `[re]` indicates assumed syllable (by editor)
- `[sol|ut]` indicates mutation that **is listed** in the text but not explicitly written out in the music notation.
- `!fa[la]|ut` indicates an explicit Tinctoris' mutation, where the first syllable is likely mistaken in the source (is fa but should be la).

## Progress

The second column indicates whether the transcription guidelines in this document are respected.
